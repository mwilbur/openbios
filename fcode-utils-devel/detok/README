1. What is the OpenBIOS detokenizer?

   detok is a GPLed FCode detokenizer. It can detokenize (disassemble)
   fcode bytecode files as described by the IEEE 1275-1994 standard.  
   This program aims towards IEEE 1275-1994 compliance, but there is no
   warranty that it is actually compliant.  Bytecode files, such as used
   with detok, normally contain Open Firmware drivers or other packages 
   for use with an Open Firmware compliant system.

   
2. What is required to build the OpenBIOS detokenizer?

   detok should build with any ANSI compliant C compiler, although
   currently only Linux on i386/alpha/ia64 are tested. To build detok 
   on other platforms you might have to adjust the Makefile.
   To build detok, just enter "make". To clean up an existing build, 
   use "make clean" or "make distclean".
   
   
3. How to use the OpenBIOS detokenizer

   detok has a couple of options that can be used for detokenizing
   fcode binaries. To use detok, use the following syntax:

   	$ detok [OPTION]... [FCODE-FILE]...

	The following options are available:
	
         -v, --verbose     print fcode numbers
         -a, --all         don't stop at end0
         -n, --linenumbers print line numbers
         -o, --offsets     print byte offsets
         -h, --help        print this help text 

	Please note: Long options are not available on all systems.

   Example:
	
    $ detok -ov world.fc
